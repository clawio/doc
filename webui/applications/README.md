# Web UI Applications

The SPA is built with [Ember](), a client-side JavaScript web application framework based on the model-view-controller (MVC) software architectural pattern. It allows developers to create scalable single-page applications by incorporating common idioms and best practices into a framework that provides a rich object model, declarative two-way data binding, computed properties, automatically-updating templates powered by Handlebars.js, and a router for managing application state.

Thanks to its flexibility we can create completely decoupled modules into our WebUI applications.

There are the following applications:

- The [Objects](objects/README.md) application manages your storage.
- The [Profile](profile/README.md) application provides information about the current user.

*Although pretty stable, WebUI lacks more features and we are working hard to provide them.*
