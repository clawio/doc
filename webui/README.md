# ClawIO Web UI

The ClawIO Web User Interface is a web application that acts as a client to the ClawIO Server Daemon (clawiod).

This application is a [SPA (single page application)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) so it can 
be deployed on any web server (Apache, Nginx, ISS, etc) without configuring any script or cgi technology.
