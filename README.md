# Welcome to ClawIO


This is the official documentation of the ClawIO project, here you can find all
the necessary information to setup and configure your ClawIO service. If you

# ClawIO

ClawIO is a Cloud [Sync] Storage Gateway solution that provides excellent performance, reliability and scalability.

- **Cloud**: ClawIO core is a dependency-free autonomous server like Nginx or Apache that exposes a set of APIs that clients can consume
in a client-server architecture.

- **[Sync]**: ClawIO allows you to synchronize your data with existing synchronization software (currently only ownCloud is supported).
Sync is in [brackets] because Synchronisation is optional and can be disabled and enabled as you wish.

- **Storage**: ClawIO interacts with existing storage solutions from local filesystems to object storages.

- **Gateway**: ClawIO acts as a gateway to existing storage solutions providing a simple and effective HTTP API.
