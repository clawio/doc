# Introduction

ClawIO is an open source on-premise cloud storage scalable sync and share server.

## Why another sync and share server ?

There are three reasons for the creation of this project:

1. Creation of a scalable sync and share server 

that provides synchronization and sharing capabilites on top of existing storage solutions.

ClawIO primary goal is to be used on top of huge data repositories based on modern exabyte-scale storage systems like EOS or GPFS, fulfilling the requirements in terms of speed and easiness without lossing performance.

ClawIO is a pioner offering Federated Cloud Sharing, a new way for organizations to collaborate sharing data across differents clouds.

ClawIO and its desktop and mobile clients are published under the AGPLv3.






ClawIO is a reference implementation prototype of two protocols:

* The Open Synchronization Protocol.
* The OpenCloudMesh Protocol

ClawIO is also sync and share server focused with scalability in mind its architectural design.
