# ClawIO

ClawIO is a Cloud [Sync] Storage solution targeted to companies and individuals who want to have a self-hosted alternative to services like DropBox, where you have full control of your data. ClawIO by default does not offer synchronisation capabilities and it just works as a high-performance gateway to your data storage. When configuring the synchronisation mechanism you can use existing synchronization clients like ownCloud's to synchronize your data with multiple devices. ClawIO was designed to be a performant, reliable and scalable solution without focusing too much on user features.
