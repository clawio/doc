# Architecture

The architecture of ClawIO is a decoupled architecture, far away from traditional MVC (Model View Controller) architectures.

The server is developed following an API Driven Development, focusing on decoupling the business logic implemented in the server from the UI (User Interface) implemented in the clients.
