# Architecture

The architecture of ClawIO is a decoupled architecture, far away from traditional MVC (Model View Controller) architectures.

The server is developed following an API Driven Development.

This approach focuses on decoupling the logic implemented in the server (sync and share) from the UI (User Interface) implemented in the clients.

Figure ??? shows an overview of the architecture.
